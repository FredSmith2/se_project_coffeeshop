# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

This project was very helpful in exercising my new abilities. I would definitely have liked to practice more of the animation elements and worked a lot more with modifiers to sharpen up those skills. I look forward to the next project.
